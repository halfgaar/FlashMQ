# Why `docbook2x-man` from the `docbook2x` Debian package, and _not_
# `docbook-to-man` from the `docbook-to-man` Debian package?  Because
# the former seems to only eat SGML (not XML) as the input format, or
# something…  Whatever the cause, it's crashing like crazy and
# `docbook2x` seems to work find (with DocBook 4; neither package has
# DocBook 5 support).

# more powerful schemas (and thus validation).
