/*
 * This file is part of FlashMQ (https://www.flashmq.org). It defines the

 *
 * This interface definition is public domain and you are encouraged
 * to copy it to your plugin project, for portability. Including
 * this file in your project does not make it a 'derivative work'.
 *
 * Compile like: gcc -fPIC -shared plugin.cpp -o plugin.so
 *
 * It's best practice to build your plugin with the same library versions of the
 * build of FlashMQ you're using. In practice, this means building on the OS
 * version you're running on. This also means using the AppImage build of FlashMQ
 * is not really compatible with plugins, because that includes older, and fixed,
 * versions of various libraries.
 *
 * For instance, if you use OpenSSL: by the time your plugin is loaded, FlashMQ will
 * have already dynamically linked OpenSSL. If you then try to call OpenSSL
 * functions, you'll run into ABI incompatibilities.
